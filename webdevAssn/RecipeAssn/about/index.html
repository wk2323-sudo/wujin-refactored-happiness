        <h2>Origins</h2>
        <p>
          The chocolate chip cookie was invented in the late 1930s in the United
          States. It is widely credited to Ruth Wakefield, who created the
          cookie at the Toll House Inn in Massachusetts. What began as a simple
          baking experiment quickly became one of the most popular cookies in
          the world.

        <h2>Texture and Variations</h2>
        <p>
          One of the reasons chocolate chip cookies remain so beloved is their
          versatility. Some people prefer thin and crispy cookies, while others
          enjoy thick, soft, and chewy centers. Baking time, temperature, and
          ingredient ratios all play a role in determining the final texture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, bakers have introduced variations such as adding nuts,
          using different types of chocolate, or adjusting sweetness levels to
          suit personal taste.

        <p>
          Chocolate chip cookies have become more than just a dessert. They are
          often associated with home, comfort, and sharing. From school lunches
          to holiday gatherings, the cookie continues to appear in everyday
          moments across cultures and generations.
